Welcome to the SR01 project on GitHub! This project is a teaching resource for learning about system operations using Linux, C++, and the Visual Studio platform. The code in this repository is designed to run on a Linux system, but can also be compiled and run on Windows using Visual Studio.

The project includes various materials to help you learn about system operations, including code samples, documentation, and example files. The **`docs`** directory contains detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project on both Linux and Windows systems.

In addition to the materials provided in this repository, the project also includes a series of lessons and exercises to guide you through the learning process. These lessons cover a range of topics, including working with processes, threads, and inter-process communication.

We hope that this project will provide a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about system operations.

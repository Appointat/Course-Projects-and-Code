# **Introduction**

Welcome to the repository, SY02, for a project on statistical methods in mathematics and statistics. This project covers topics such as maximum likelihood estimation, variance estimation, hypothesis testing, and testing for Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions.

# **Prerequisites**

Before starting this project, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of probability theory and statistical concepts. Some familiarity with programming, preferably in Python, will also be helpful as the project includes code examples and exercises.

# **Contents**

The project consists of the following parts:

- Part 1: Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Part 2: Variance Estimation
- Part 3: Hypothesis Testing
- Part 4: Testing for Gaussian and Non-Gaussian Distributions

Each part includes a mix of theory and practical examples, with exercises for you to practice and apply the concepts learned.

# **Setup**

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook **`main.ipynb`** and follow the instructions in the notebook to get started.

# **Contributing**
